Bomcheck
========

Bomcheck is a command line weather checker for Australians


Year 12 (Final year) is hard as all hell so it looks like I won't be working anymore on this until I finish my research project (Which is good, I'll have more time to actually learn Haskell!), so for all the 0 people looking forward to this, wait until after July for development to restart. By then this'll be my main project and I'll try to get it in a working state as soon as possible, but until then have fun with the terrible code.

Install
-------

This is still a young project so expect breakages. If you just want to test it then download a pre-build binary. If you want to help develop clone the repo and build with cabal. But really it's in a bad state right now, it's often not able to build as I often just work by running functions in ghci and testing them. You have been warned!

Using
-----

1. Widgets - Check Readme in widget directory for more info
2. Command-line - You probably know what you want to do anyway
