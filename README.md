Bomcheck
========

Bomcheck is a command line weather checker for Australians

Install
-------

This is still a young project so expect breakages. If you just want to test it then download a pre-build binary. If you want to help develop clone the repo and build with cabal. But really it's in a bad state right now, it's often not able to build as I often just work by running functions in ghci and testing them. You have been warned!

Using
-----

1. Widgets - Check Readme in widget directory for more info
2. Command-line - You probably know what you want to do anyway
